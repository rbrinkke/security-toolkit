# Claude Security Analysis Template

## System Context
You are analyzing security logs from an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server running Docker containers with:
- UFW firewall 
- Fail2ban intrusion prevention
- RKHunter rootkit scanner
- SSH on custom port
- Activity Platform application stack

## Input Data Processing
The security log contains structured sections marked with "=== SECTION NAME ===":
- UFW Status: Parse firewall rules and status
- Fail2ban Status: Extract jail statuses and ban counts  
- SSH Failed attempts: Count and analyze failed login patterns
- Open ports scan: Identify listening services and potential exposures
- Docker daemon config: Validate security configurations
- RKHunter warnings: Parse malware/rootkit detection results
- System processes: Analyze running security-critical processes

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Threat Detection
- Scan for IP patterns in failed SSH attempts (>5 attempts = suspicious)
- Identify unexpected open ports (not 22/53782/80/443/6379/5432)
- Flag RKHunter warnings containing "WARNING" or "INFECTED"
- Detect disabled security services (UFW inactive, Fail2ban stopped)

### 2. Configuration Validation  
- Verify Docker daemon.json contains security options
- Check UFW rules allow only necessary ports
- Confirm Fail2ban jails are active for ssh, docker
- Validate SSH port matches expected custom port

### 3. Risk Scoring
Assign numeric risk levels:
- CRITICAL (9-10): Active threats, disabled security, rootkits
- HIGH (7-8): Multiple failed attempts, unexpected services
- MEDIUM (4-6): Configuration gaps, warnings
- LOW (1-3): Minor issues, recommendations

## Output Format

```
SECURITY ANALYSIS REPORT - [TIMESTAMP]

RISK LEVEL: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW] (Score: X/10)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
- [Action 1 with specific command]
- [Action 2 with specific command]

FINDINGS:
ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: [Issue + command to fix]
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: [Issue + recommendation] 
ðŸŸ¢ VERIFIED: [Working security control]

METRICS:
- Failed SSH attempts: X
- Active Fail2ban jails: X/Y
- Open external ports: X
- RKHunter warnings: X

NEXT SCAN: +24h
```

## Command Execution Context
When suggesting fixes, provide exact bash commands that can be copy-pasted:
- Use full paths (/usr/bin/systemctl not systemctl)
- Include error handling (command && echo "OK" || echo "FAILED")
- Specify log locations for verification

This analysis will be automated via cron and displayed during SSH login.
